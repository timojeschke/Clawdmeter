# Clawdmeter

<img src="assets/readme/waving.gif" width="120" align="right" alt="">

A small ESP32 dashboard I made for my desk to keep an eye on Claude Code usage.

It runs on a [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-amoled-2.16.htm?&aff_id=149786) as well as a few other alternative boards and pairs over Bluetooth, the splash screen plays pixel-art Clawd animations that get
busier when your usage rate climbs. The two side buttons turn pages on a tap
and send Space or Shift+Tab over BLE HID when held, for Claude Code's voice
mode and mode-toggle shortcuts.

## Screens

The screens form a carousel. **Tap a side button to turn the page**, wrapping at both ends; a board with only one side button steps forward and still reaches every page.

|              Splash               |              Usage              |
| :-------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
| ![Splash](screenshots/splash.gif) | ![Usage](screenshots/usage.png) |
|     Splash; side buttons page     | Session and weekly utilization  |

**Tapping the panel acts on the page you are looking at**: on the splash it cycles to the next animation, on the usage view it steps through the four brightness levels. The firmware also auto-rotates animations every 20 s within the current usage-rate group, so a long stretch on the splash isn't just one Clawd on loop.

**A short press of the middle (PWR) button puts the panel to sleep right away** instead of waiting out the idle timeout — and it stays asleep even on USB power, until you press something. **Hold the power button for about 3 seconds, then release, to enter pairing mode** — this clears the saved Bluetooth bond and re-advertises. Keep holding past ~6 s and the gesture disarms; the PMU cuts power at 8 s, so a deliberate power-off never wipes the bond.

**Porting to another board:** the firmware is a thin HAL with per-board folders under `firmware/src/boards/`. Drop in a new folder and a new PlatformIO env — `main.cpp`, `ui.cpp`, and `splash.cpp` never need to change. See [`docs/porting/adding-a-board.md`](docs/porting/adding-a-board.md) for the walk-through and [`docs/porting/hal-contract.md`](docs/porting/hal-contract.md) for the interfaces a port must implement.

## Prerequisites

- Linux (tested on Ubuntu), macOS, or Windows 10/11
- [PlatformIO CLI](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/index.html)
- Linux: `curl`, `bluetoothctl`, `busctl`, `dbus-monitor` (BlueZ Bluetooth stack), `python3`, `setsid`, `stdbuf` (util-linux / coreutils), `systemctl` (systemd user services)
- macOS: `python3` (the installer sets up a venv with `bleak` and `httpx`)
- Windows: `python3` 3.11+ (the installer sets up a venv with `bleak`, `httpx`, and `pystray`)
- Claude Code with an active subscription

## macOS installation

The macOS host pieces — Python daemon, LaunchAgent, and flash helper — were ported by [Chris Davidson (@lorddavidson)](https://github.com/lorddavidson). Thanks Chris!

### Flash the firmware

```bash
./flash-mac.sh waveshare_amoled_216                       # ESP32-S3 2.16" (auto-detects /dev/cu.usbmodem*)
./flash-mac.sh waveshare_amoled_216_c6                    # ESP32-C6 2.16" variant
./flash-mac.sh waveshare_amoled_18  /dev/cu.usbmodem1101  # ESP32-S3 1.8" (or pass an explicit USB serial port)
```

The board env name is required. Run `./flash-mac.sh` with no args to see the available envs (scraped from `firmware/platformio.ini`).

### Pair the device

After flashing, open **System Settings → Bluetooth** and click _Connect_ next to "Clawdmeter". The daemon only ever connects to the peripheral this Mac is paired/connected to — it never scans for a nearby device — so once it's connected here the daemon picks it up on its next poll (~60 s).

### Install the daemon

The daemon reads your Claude OAuth token from the macOS Keychain (service `Claude Code-credentials`), polls usage every 60 s, and pushes it to the display over BLE.

```bash
./install-mac.sh
```

The installer creates a Python venv in `daemon/.venv/`, installs `bleak` and `httpx`, renders a LaunchAgent into `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.claude-usage-daemon.plist`, and loads it. The first run is launched interactively so macOS prompts for Bluetooth permission.

Useful commands:

```bash
launchctl list | grep claude-usage                                          # check it's running
tail -F ~/Library/Logs/claude-usage-daemon.out.log                          # live logs
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.claude-usage-daemon.plist  # stop
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.claude-usage-daemon.plist # start
```

## Linux installation

### Flash the firmware

```bash
./flash.sh waveshare_amoled_216                  # ESP32-S3 2.16" (defaults to /dev/ttyACM0)
./flash.sh waveshare_amoled_216_c6               # ESP32-C6 2.16" variant
./flash.sh waveshare_amoled_18  /dev/ttyACM1     # ESP32-S3 1.8" (or pass an explicit USB serial port)
```

The board env name is required. Run `./flash.sh` with no args to see the available envs (scraped from `firmware/platformio.ini`).

### Pair the device

After flashing, the device advertises as "Clawdmeter". Pair it once:

```bash
# Scan for the device
bluetoothctl scan le

# When "Clawdmeter" appears, pair and trust it
bluetoothctl pair F4:12:FA:C0:8F:E5    # use your device's MAC
bluetoothctl trust F4:12:FA:C0:8F:E5
```

To re-pair later, hold the power button for 3 seconds then release — the device clears its saved bond and re-advertises.

### Install the daemon

The daemon polls your Claude usage every 60 seconds and sends it to the display over BLE.

```bash
./install.sh
systemctl --user start claude-usage-daemon
```

Check status: `systemctl --user status claude-usage-daemon`

View logs: `journalctl --user -u claude-usage-daemon -f`

To change the poll interval, set `poll_interval = <seconds>` in `~/.config/claude-usage-monitor/config` (see `daemon/config.example`). The daemon picks it up without a restart. Polling slower than ~80s is fine: between polls the daemon replays the last payload every `heartbeat_interval` seconds (default 60) with the reset countdowns aged, so the firmware's 90s freshness window never lapses and no reflash is needed.

## Windows installation

Runs natively on Windows — no WSL required. A system-tray app polls your usage and pushes it over BLE, and starts automatically at login.

### Prerequisites

- **Native Windows** (not WSL).
- **Python 3.11+** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) — check _"Add python.exe to PATH"_ during install.
- **Claude Code** installed, with `claude login` completed. The token is read from `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json` (falling back to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude\` then `%APPDATA%\Claude\`).
- The repo on a **native Windows path** (e.g. `%USERPROFILE%\Clawdmeter`), **not** a `\\wsl$` share — the installer refuses a WSL path.

### Flash the firmware

```powershell
pio run -d firmware -e waveshare_amoled_216 -t upload --upload-port COM5   # use your device's COM port
```

Run `pio run -d firmware` with no env to see the available board envs.

### Pair the device

The device is a bonded BLE HID keyboard, so pair it once: **Settings → Bluetooth & devices → Add device → Bluetooth**, then select "Clawdmeter". Pairing is **required** — it enables the physical buttons and keeps a persistent connection (the device keeps showing your last-synced usage even after the daemon quits). To undo, use **Remove device** (this disables the buttons).

### Install the daemon (recommended)

From the repo root in PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install-windows.ps1
```

This creates a venv, installs `bleak`/`httpx`/`pystray`/`Pillow` from the in-repo requirements (no internet downloads), registers a per-user login-autostart entry (`HKCU\…\Run`, no admin needed), and launches the tray app headlessly (no console window).

### Run manually instead (optional)

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1        # if blocked: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned, then retry
pip install -r daemon\requirements-windows.txt
python daemon\claude_usage_daemon_windows.py        # runs in the foreground; Ctrl+C to stop
```

### Tray icon and menu

The icon's corner bubble shows state — **green** Connected, **amber** Scanning, **red** Error — and hovering shows the status (`Connected · last update HH:MM`). A notification fires once when it enters Error (e.g. an expired token). Right-click for the menu:

- **Status header** — live state + last sync time.
- **Start at login** — toggle autostart on/off.
- **Quit** — stops the daemon cleanly; leaves the Windows pairing intact (device keeps its last reading).

### Logs and troubleshooting

```powershell
Get-Content $env:LOCALAPPDATA\Clawdmeter\daemon.log -Tail 30        # view logs
reg delete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v Clawdmeter /f   # remove autostart
```

## How it works

<img src="assets/readme/magnifier.gif" width="150" align="right" alt="">

1. The daemon reads your Claude Code OAuth token — from the macOS Keychain (service `Claude Code-credentials`) on macOS, or from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` on Linux (`%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json` on Windows).
2. It makes a minimal API call to `api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` — one token of Haiku, basically free.
3. The usage numbers come straight out of the response headers (`anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-utilization` and friends).
4. The daemon connects to the ESP32 over BLE and writes a JSON payload to the GATT RX characteristic.
5. The firmware parses it and updates the LVGL dashboard.
6. The firmware also tracks the rate of change of session % over a 5-minute window and picks splash animations from the matching mood group.
7. The HID side of the side buttons is independent of all of this — Space and Shift+Tab go straight to the paired host as keyboard input.

## Physical buttons

Each side button carries two actions: **tap to turn a page, hold to send its HID key.** The threshold is 250 ms, which is also how long Space is delayed — the price of one button doing two jobs. Push-to-talk is a hold gesture anyway, so that is where the delay hurts least.

| Button           | Tap                        | Hold                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Left**         | Previous page              | Space (Claude Code voice-mode push-to-talk)       |
| **Right**        | Next page                  | Shift+Tab (Claude Code mode toggle)               |
| **Middle** (PWR) | Sleep now                  | ~3 s + release: pairing mode · 8 s: power off     |

Space and Shift+Tab go out as standard BLE HID keyboard reports, so they trigger in whatever window has focus on the paired host — not just Claude Code. **They only work while the device is connected**; with no bond, the side buttons still turn pages but send nothing.

The first press after the panel has gone dark is swallowed as a wake — no page turn, no keystroke.

### Not every board has three buttons

The table above describes the AMOLED-2.16. The other ports differ, and shared code adapts via `BoardCaps::button_count`:

| Board                        | Side buttons        | Shift+Tab? |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- |
| AMOLED-2.16 (S3)             | 2 (GPIO 0 / 18)     | yes        |
| AMOLED-2.16 (C6)             | 2 (GPIO 9 / 10)     | yes        |
| LCD-1.54                     | 2 (GPIO 0 / 5)      | yes        |
| AMOLED-1.8 (S3 and C6)       | 1                   | no         |
| AMOLED-2.06                  | 1                   | no         |
| LCD-4                        | 1, and no PWR       | no         |

**On one-button boards the single button steps forward only** — it still reaches every page, it just always wraps the same way. The LCD-4 has no PWR button at all (KEY is wired to hardware reset), so sleep-on-demand and the pairing gesture are unavailable there; tap the panel instead.

## BLE protocol

The device advertises a custom GATT service alongside the standard HID keyboard service:

|                            | UUID                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Data Service**           | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000001` |
| RX Characteristic (write)  | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000002` |
| TX Characteristic (notify) | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000003` |
| **HID Service**            | `00001812-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` |

JSON payload format (written to RX):

```json
{ "s": 45, "sr": 120, "w": 28, "wr": 7200, "st": "allowed", "ok": true }
```

Fields: `s` = session %, `sr` = session reset (minutes), `w` = weekly %, `wr` = weekly reset (minutes), `st` = status, `ok` = success flag.

## Development

- **Desktop simulator** — iterate on the UI without hardware: an SDL2 window
  runs the full firmware loop with scenario playback (`pio run -d firmware -e
sim`, then `cd firmware && .pio/build/sim/program`). See
  [`SIM-USAGE.md`](SIM-USAGE.md) for controls, scenarios, and headless
  screenshots.
- **Splash animations** — Anthropic's official Clawd sprites, archived with
  provenance notes in [`research/clawd-official/`](research/clawd-official/);
  `node tools/convert_official_clawd.js` regenerates
  `firmware/src/splash_animations.h`. See [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md).
- **Icons** — Lucide PNGs convert to LVGL C arrays with
  `tools/png_to_lvgl.js`. See [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md).
- **Fonts** — the pre-compiled LVGL fonts and the LVGL-9 patching they need:
  [`docs/fonts.md`](docs/fonts.md).
